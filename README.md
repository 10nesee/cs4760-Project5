Project 5

This project simulates how an operating system's resource management component manages many child processes. It makes use of resource descriptors to monitor resource allocation, requests, and releases; shared memory for a system clock; and message queues for communication. Resource management, signal handling, inter-process communication, deadlock detection and resolution, and logging are all implemented in this project. To fulfill project requirements, the remaining tasks include improving probabilities for a deadlock situations and optimizing resource allocation policies.
